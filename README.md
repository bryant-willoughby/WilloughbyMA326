# MA 326: Mathematical Foundations of Data Science 

I contributed equally to a group project for MA 326. We explored two image classification algorithms and investigated the impact of low-rank approximation.

MA_326_Project.pdf is the final paper that describes our analysis. 

We used two publicly available datasets in our project: 
- Hand-written digits (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/80/optical+recognition+of+handwritten+digits)
- Complex color images (https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)

The code used in this project has the following files and methods: 
1. LRA.py
2. SVMCommon.py
3. SVMComplex.py
4. SVMSimple.py
5. kmeansCommon.py
6. kmeansComplicated.py
7. kmeansComplicated.py
